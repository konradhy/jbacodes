# 🎉 Vite React Frontend Setup Complete!

The frontend has been completely rebuilt using **Vite + React + TypeScript** for a much better development experience.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Run Backend Only (Production Mode)
```bash
npm run dev
```
This serves the built React app from `frontend/dist/` via the Express backend at `http://localhost:3000`

### Option 2: Run With Frontend Auto-Rebuild
```bash
npm run start-all
```
This rebuilds the frontend and then starts the backend server.

## 🔧 Development

### Backend Development
```bash
npm run dev
```
- Backend runs on `http://localhost:3000`
- Serves the React app from `frontend/dist/`
- Hot-reloads backend changes

### Frontend Development
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
- Frontend dev server runs on `http://localhost:5173`
- Hot-reloads React changes
- Proxies API calls to backend on `:3000`

### Build Commands
```bash
npm run build-frontend    # Build React app
npm run build            # Build backend
npm run build-all        # Build both
```

## ✅ What's Fixed

- **No more manual TypeScript compilation!** Vite handles everything
- **Hot reloading** for both frontend and backend
- **Modern React components** with TypeScript
- **Clean state management** with React hooks
- **Responsive design** with modern CSS
- **Same debug transcript display** with red borders for testing

## 🎯 Test The App

1. **Open browser** → `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Go to Sessions** → Click your completed session
3. **Look for the red-bordered transcript box** with your actual transcript text!

## 📁 Project Structure

```
├── frontend/           # Vite React TypeScript app
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── App.tsx     # Main React components
│   │   └── App.css     # Modern styling
│   └── dist/           # Built files (served by backend)
├── src/                # Express backend
│   ├── server.ts       # Main server (serves React from frontend/dist)
│   └── services/       # Backend services
└── data/               # Session storage
```

## 🐛 Debug Features

The Results view still includes the **debug red-bordered box** that shows:
- ✅ Raw transcript text 
- ✅ Confidence scores
- ✅ Word counts

Once you confirm the transcript appears correctly, we can make it look pretty!

**The frustrating manual compilation is GONE!** 🎉 Enjoy the smooth development experience!
