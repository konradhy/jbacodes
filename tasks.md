### Execution Notes
1. **Solo laptop workflow** â€“ Complete sections 1â†’7; deployment tasks are optional.  
2. **Large file handling** â€“ If you rarely process >500 MB, defer AF-2 and deployment storage tasks.  
3. **Iterative development** â€“ Mark tasks as *In Progress* / *Done* as you implement features.  
4. **Refactor allowance** â€“ Budget time for code cleanup after core flow is stable.
