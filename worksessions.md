## Session Log

### Session 3 - Frontend Development (Current)
**Started**: Frontend static assets implementation  
**Goal**: Create responsive HTML layout, modern CSS styling, and TypeScript frontend logic

**Checklist**:
- [x] Build responsive index.html layout (FE-1)
- [x] Implement modern styling in styles.css with Inter font + Font Awesome (FE-2)
- [x] Develop TypeScript frontend logic in app.ts (FE-3)
- [x] Implement drag-and-drop upload UI (FE-4)
- [x] Display real-time upload & processing status (FE-5)
- [x] Build transcript viewer with highlighted JBA codes (FE-6)

**Current Task**: Frontend development complete ✅

### Session 1 - Project Setup & Foundation
**Started**: Initial project examination  
**Goal**: Set up project structure, package.json, and begin Express server implementation

**Checklist**:
- [x] Read existing requirements, tasks, and README
- [x] Create worksessions.md tracking document
- [x] Create package.json with dependencies
- [x] Set up directory structure (src/, public/, data/, uploads/, videos/)
- [x] Implement Express server bootstrap (BE-1)
- [x] Configure Multer for file uploads (BE-2)

**Directory Structure Created**:

**Technical Decisions**:
- Using existing tsconfig.json configuration (ES2020, strict mode)
- Will follow the requirements.md file structure exactly
- Starting with core backend setup before frontend

**Current Task**: Full-stack application complete ✅ - Ready for production use
